Top 6 General Business Solutions
1.	Custom SaaS Platforms — Multi-tenant VPC + Service Mesh
Isolated VPCs per tenant (or namespaces) inside a cloud region, Kubernetes microservices fronted by ingress, service mesh for secure east-west traffic and autoscaling.
2.	Enterprise Portals — Hub-and-Spoke Hybrid Cloud
Central hub (identity, SSO, API gateway) in a secure cloud region with spokes for branch offices / on-prem apps over VPN/SD-WAN for low-latency access.
3.	Compliance & Reporting Automation — Segmented DMZ + Data Lake Overlay
DMZ for ingestion and transformation, separate compliance VLANs with immutable storage (WORM) and an isolated data-lake network overlay for auditing and egress control.
4.	ITIL-Based ITSM Kits — Zero-Trust Access Fabric
Internal service desk systems on a segmented LAN with ZTNA (identity-based microsegmentation), bastion hosts for admin access and out-of-band management network.
5.	Operational Playbooks & SOP Generators — Bastioned Workflow Cluster
Hardened orchestration cluster (CI/CD + automation controllers) in a management VPC, separated from production networks via bastions and role-based network policies.
6.	Enterprise Recovery Kits — Multi-Site Active/Passive DR with SD-WAN
Primary and DR sites connected by encrypted SD-WAN, asynchronous replication over dedicated replication VLANs and automated failover orchestration.

Top 6 Niche Business Solutions
1.	Secure DeFi Launch Pack — Multi-Cloud Active/Active + Blockchain Overlay
Active/active deployment across clouds with dedicated blockchain P2P overlay networks, HSMs in isolated subnets and load-balanced API gateways.
2.	NFT Marketplaces & Ticketing Systems — Edge-Accelerated CDN + API Gateway Topology
CDN + edge cache for content, central API gateway to microservices, and a secure wallet node cluster in segregated subnets.
3.	Quantitative Trading Platforms — Leaf-Spine Low-Latency Fabric (Colo + DMA)
Colocated leaf-spine network with deterministic switching, separate market data multicast network and direct market access (DMA) fabric with hardware timestamping.
4.	Fraud & Scam Detection Dashboards — Event-Driven Stream Processing Mesh
High-throughput pub/sub overlay (Kafka/MQ) connecting collectors → stream processors → analytics cluster, with TAP/SPAN feeds and SIEM ingestion lanes.
5.	AI-Powered Rug Pull Detection — Edge Telemetry + Central ML Training Cluster
Distributed lightweight collectors at exchange endpoints feeding a central GPU training cluster over secure overlays; inference nodes at edge for low latency.
6.	DAO Governance Platforms — P2P Overlay + API Gateway
Fully decentralized P2P blockchain overlay for on-chain votes, with an API gateway and relay nodes for UIs and indexing services in separate subnets.
