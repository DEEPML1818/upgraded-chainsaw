Each of the 6 solutions should be represented as a cloud/infra-style topology diagram (not just icons). The diagrams must look professional, clean, and enterprise-friendly (like AWS/Azure architecture diagrams, or NIST security topology charts).

Use standard IT symbols:

Cloud = ☁️ / cloud icon

Server racks = 🖥️ / stack rectangles

VPCs / network segments = rounded boxes

Firewalls = 🔥 or shield wall

VPN/SD-WAN links = dotted/curved arrows

Identity/SSO = 👤 key or lock

Service Mesh = interconnected hexagons or arrows inside cluster

Bastion = padlock + server icon

DR = two sites mirrored with replication arrows

🔹 Solution 1: Custom SaaS Platforms — Multi-Tenant VPC + Service Mesh

Topology to Show:

Multiple isolated tenant VPCs (boxes) inside one cloud region

Kubernetes microservices inside each VPC

Ingress gateway at the edge

Service mesh interconnecting microservices

Autoscaler icon

🔹 Solution 2: Enterprise Portals — Hub-and-Spoke Hybrid Cloud

Topology to Show:

Central Hub: Identity + SSO + API Gateway in cloud

Spokes: Branch offices + On-Prem apps

Connections: VPN/SD-WAN tunnels (arrows)

Users authenticate via central hub then connect to apps

🔹 Solution 3: Compliance & Reporting Automation — Segmented DMZ + Data Lake Overlay

Topology to Show:

DMZ network layer for data ingestion

VLANs for compliance segregation

WORM (Write Once Read Many) storage node

Data Lake overlay (isolated cluster)

Audit/reporting engine with secure egress

🔹 Solution 4: ITIL-Based ITSM Kits — Zero-Trust Access Fabric

Topology to Show:

Service Desk server cluster

ZTNA gateway in front

Bastion hosts for admin access

Segmented LAN + out-of-band mgmt network

Microsegmentation lines (per-user/per-service)

🔹 Solution 5: Operational Playbooks & SOP Generators — Bastioned Workflow Cluster

Topology to Show:

CI/CD + Automation Controllers cluster

Isolated “Management VPC”

Bastion node separating management VPC from production VPC

Role-based access lines between networks

Workflow automation nodes connected downstream

🔹 Solution 6: Enterprise Recovery Kits — Multi-Site Active/Passive DR with SD-WAN

Topology to Show:

Two sites (Primary + DR)

Encrypted SD-WAN tunnel connecting them

Replication VLAN with asynchronous arrows

Failover orchestrator icon

Users switch automatically to DR during outage

🔹 Diagram Styling Instructions

Use enterprise topology look (similar to AWS/Azure architecture diagrams).

Keep blue/grey/white corporate palette.

Use rounded rectangles for VPCs/networks, cylinders for storage, arrows for flows.

Make all diagrams consistent in style so the six can be showcased in one section grid.

Add labels under each diagram: solution name + 1-line caption.

✅ Deliverable

6 clean network topology diagrams (one per solution)

Professional enterprise styling

Consistent legend/icons across all six
