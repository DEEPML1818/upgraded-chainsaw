# AI Agent Prompt: Create Interactive Network Topology

You are an expert network architect and web developer. I need you to create an interactive network topology visualization using HTML, CSS, and SVG. Follow these EXACT specifications:

## ARCHITECTURE TO BUILD:
**[INSERT SPECIFIC ARCHITECTURE HERE - e.g., "Hub-and-Spoke Hybrid Cloud"]**

## MANDATORY DESIGN REQUIREMENTS:

### VISUAL STYLE:
- Purple-blue gradient background: `linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%)`
- White topology container with `backdrop-filter: blur(10px)` and `border-radius: 20px`
- Animated glowing title with `animation: titleGlow 3s ease-in-out infinite alternate`
- Glass morphism effect on all containers with transparency

### RESPONSIVE LAYOUT:
- Use viewport units (vw/vh) for ALL positioning - NO fixed pixels
- Container: `width: 95vw; height: 90vh`
- Components: sizes like `width: 6vw; height: 8vh`
- SVG with `viewBox="0 0 100 100"` and `preserveAspectRatio="none"`
- Connection coordinates in percentages (0-100) with `vector-effect="non-scaling-stroke"`

### NETWORK ZONES (5-7 zones required):
Each zone must have:
- Dashed colored borders with `border-radius: 15px`
- Gradient backgrounds with 10% opacity
- Zone labels positioned at `top: -12px; left: 15px`
- Hover effects with `transform: scale(1.02)`

### NETWORK COMPONENTS (10-15 components required):
Each component must have:
- White background with colored borders (3px solid)
- Gradient backgrounds matching component type
- Emoji icons with `animation: iconBounce 2s ease-in-out infinite`
- Green pulsing status dots with `animation: statusPulse 2s ease-in-out infinite`
- Hover effects: `transform: translateY(-8px) scale(1.05)`

### CONNECTION SYSTEM (CRITICAL):
Create 4 connection types with SVG paths:

1. **STANDARD**: `stroke: #2196f3; stroke-width: 3;`
2. **SECURE**: `stroke: #4caf50; stroke-width: 4;`
3. **ENCRYPTED**: `stroke: #ff9800; stroke-dasharray: 8 4;`
4. **HIGH TRAFFIC**: `stroke: #f44336; stroke-width: 5;`

### CONNECTION MID-POINT LABELS (MANDATORY):
Add small labels at connection midpoints showing protocols:
- VPN, AUTH, API, DATA, CACHE, PROXY, LB, MESH, FILTER, ROUTE, QUEUE, SYNC
- Position with `transform: translateX(-50%) translateY(-50%)`
- Glowing animation: `animation: labelGlow 3s ease-in-out infinite`

### REQUIRED ANIMATIONS:
```css
@keyframes titleGlow {
    from { text-shadow: 2px 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.3); }
    to { text-shadow: 2px 2px 20px rgba(255,255,255,0.5); }
}

@keyframes iconBounce {
    0%, 20%, 50%, 80%, 100% { transform: translateY(0); }
    40% { transform: translateY(-5px); }
    60% { transform: translateY(-3px); }
}

@keyframes statusPulse {
    0%, 100% { opacity: 1; transform: scale(1); }
    50% { opacity: 0.6; transform: scale(1.2); }
}

@keyframes dataFlow {
    0%, 100% { stroke-dashoffset: 0; }
    50% { stroke-dashoffset: 20; }
}
```

### LEGEND (Required):
Bottom-right corner with:
- 4 connection type examples with colored lines
- Glass effect background
- Hover effects on legend items
